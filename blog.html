           On Tuesday Eric Cantor lost in a primary election against a relatively unknown Tea Party challenger.  As far as I can tell no one in America, possibly not even Dave Brat, thought this would happen. My first thought, jokingly, was, “Why didn’t Nate Silver tell us??”</p>
<p>
While Nate has been chumming clickbait at 538, more serious statisticians have been hard at work solving the problem of predicting the future — or, at least, allowing folks to bet on it. Yesterday I came across <a href="https://github.com/psztorc/Truthcoin">Truthcoin</a>, a new protocol for creating predictive markets. I think it’s incredibly powerful and will have a number of far-reaching effects — not only as a supplement for polls in the 2016 electoral cycle, but also for ALL markets worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Truthcoin is described by its creator as a “trustless P2P prediction-marketplace” — “a market for actual prediction-commodities, which have a value based on their accuracy and not based on the behaviour of any administrator, rival trader, or counterparty.” I don’t want to go too far into the weeds of “coins” and the “blockchain,” but in short: this is a way to bet on any determined event for which you can find a counterparty. If there’s a reasonable volume of transactions around a particular, defined event — let’s say the winner of the 2016 presidential election — then we’d call that a market. The key elements of Truthcoin that weren’t present in previous iterations of predictive markets are that: (1) it’s “decentralized” — there isn’t one bookie setting the line and clearing funds; (2) it’s more or less beyond the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities; (3) it has negligible transaction fees; (4) anyone can make a market. It’s like a <b>marketplace for derivatives</b> — a marketplace for markets that contain information about other markets. So why is this important, or, I argue, revolutionary?
</p></p>
In 2012, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/johncassidy/2013/03/whatever-happened-to-intrade.html">Intrade</a>, a prediction market, nailed the election results (so did Nate Silver, of course, but that was before he slid into statistical insignificance). Soon after the election the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued the company — not for its elections bets but rather for what were essentially unregulated commodities derivatives markets. So far there hasn’t really been a replacement — there are bookies, whether illegal corner-store guys, in Vegas, or overseas — but these are also fairly regulated, and the illegal guys find it difficult to scale, or to offer esoteric “lines,” like on overseas elections, or Cantor’s primary. Besides, the transaction costs in order to move all that money around were too high.
</p></p>
One of the greatest (and perhaps most important) attributes of markets is their ability to communicate information through price signals. Information asymmetries are temporarily rewarded (arbitrage) and then, typically, eliminated, as (a) more people try to seize the new information or (b) the market figures out that somebody knows something they don’t, and creates rules to stop that from happening systematically. So - for example - high-frequency traders have been trying to figure out what the price of a stock is in one market, and then take advantage of any price differentials with another market — e.g., by getting information from New York to Chicago more quickly than anyone else through specially-laid fiber optic cables. An example of (b) is insider trading rules: if I’m the CEO of a publicly traded company and I find out it’s going in the toilet, I can’t sell all my shares before anyone else knows (and my bookie/golf buddy can’t either, technically, at least if it can be proven that I told him).
</p></p>
The “invisible hand” is actually information. You can’t see it, but that’s what’s really moving around among market participants — whether it’s knowledge of the actual information that moved the price, OR derivative knowledge, simply knowing about the new price itself. The other fascinating thing about markets — perhaps the MOST fascinating thing — is that it only takes one person in the market to know something new in order to dramatically change the price, because price-setting happens at the margin.
</p></p>
Let’s say we’re in a market for Pokemon cards on the playground. Let’s also say there are thousands of us milling around — OK, maybe this is more like a convention. In Japan, at the same moment, the head honcho at Pokemon decides that no more Charizard cards, or whatever, will ever be made again. He calls me and tells me. Suddenly I possess very valuable information that no one else at the convention has: Charizard cards are soon going to be really expensive. I walk over to a nearby group, trying to act casual. “Hey — I’d like to buy a Charizard or two.” I buy one, successfully, at $1. I buy two. I buy 10. Someone looks suspicious — “No, I’m just really into it — promise.” But gradually people in the room notice that one guy is buying Charizards like a maniac, and demand a higher price. Without the rest of the room even knowing about my friend in Tokyo, the price change has indicated that there’s information that will change the price — because it already has changed the price.
</p></p>
<i>Markets enable the movement of information from one to many in an extremely efficient manner.</i>
</p></p>
Truthcoin allows for the creation of public, decentralized, unregulated markets for information — essentially derivative markets in anything. I think this represents the most powerful application of the blockchain. There will be betting and speculation, like in all markets, but also information-sharing. Look at the accuracy of presidential betting markets in the past, and apply that much more broadly to a whole range of defined but unknown events. If you’re a Singularity type (I’m not) — this is getting pretty damn close.
</p></p>
My difficulty to date with Ethereum, NXT, Mastercoin, etc was that I couldn’t figure out a use case. I don’t think the digital asset stuff holds much water. How many people want to buy digital art? How many people want to set up a “decentralized autonomous corporation” to provide supplementary car insurance for a group of 20 friends? How many people want a “trustless” escrow and digital key function, with no intermediaries or wire transfer fees, to exchange payment for ownership of a car in Kenya, while one party to the transaction is not in the country? I’m pretty sure these are edge cases.
</p></p>
But information is no edge case. Think about the future of: stock prices, World Cup games, Predictive markets will enable speculative trading in all of these by offering global accessibility, negligible transaction costs, a fairly “trustworthy” system (because, for those in the know, it’s “trustless”), and zero regulatory constraints. The latter is a problem, and something that our global society will have to sort out; but at least corruption like World Cup match-fixing is apparent in aberrant market movements, so “honest bettors” will know when they’re getting screwed. I don’t mean to downplay the illegality of much of this; it’s going to be a few orders of magnitude larger than today’s “Flash Boys.” 
</p></p>
For @a16z fans: the “internet of information” and the “internet of value” are inextricably linked: value is the only way to effectively sustain, curate, and rank the internet of information. The initial concept behind Bitcoin came in an attempt to stop spam: if everyone had to pay a tiny tax on each email sent, most people would pay only a penny — but spammers would be forced to pay many pretty pennies, driving them out of business. The true value of the block chain will be in enabling tiny transactions, including tiny bets in predictive markets, to make sense of the information that surrounds us, and events yet to come.
</p></p>
By inextricably linking “information” and “value” in predictive markets — using a decentralized, distributed ledger as the infrastructure for contracts, “good funds” verification, clearing, and settlement — the internet suddenly becomes much, much more valuable. Previously the internet was a way to access information, but with little indication of veracity. Now there’s a way to value that information: a system of rewards for accuracy and truthfulness.
</p></p>
If you’re interested in talking about this more, shoot me an email at thomas at corevc dot com. The big idea is creating a marketplace for information — and doing it in a decentralized way. The power of this marketplace will be incredible: we’ll see the next David Brat coming from a mile away, not that it will necessary be any easier to prevent unlikely events from happening.</p>
